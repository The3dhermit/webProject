                <p> <strong>Dick Butt</strong> is an illustration of an anthropomorphic phallus with a pair of testicles
                    and a penis protruding from its backside. In multi-pane image macros and animated GIFs,
                    the drawing is often revealed unexpectedly in the final frame.
